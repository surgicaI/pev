   trying to find a match in the second set. All matching records are returned.`,

   'HASH': `generates a hash table from the records in the input recordset. Hash is used by
   <strong>Hash Join</strong>.`,

   'HASHAGGREGATE': `groups records together based on a GROUP BY or aggregate function (like sum()). Hash Aggregate uses
   a hash to first organize the records by a key.`,

   Seq Scans (unlike Index Scans) perform a single read operation (only the table is read).`,
   'INDEX SCAN': `finds relevant records based on an <strong>Index</strong>. Index Scans perform 2 read operations: one to
   read the index and another to read the actual value from the table.`,

   from the index and do not read from the corresponding table.`,

   'BITMAP INDEX SCAN': `uses a <strong>Bitmap Index</strong> (index which uses 1 bit per page) to find all relevant pages.
   Results of this node are fed to the <strong>Bitmap Heap Scan</strong>.`,
   'CTE SCAN': `performs a sequential scan of <strong>Common Table Expression (CTE) query</strong> results. Note that
   results of a CTE are materialized (calculated and temporarily stored).`
